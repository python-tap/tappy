tappy - TAP tools for Python
============================

.. image:: images/tap.png

tappy provides tools for working with the
`Test Anything Protocol (TAP) <http://testanything.org>`_
in Python.

tappy generates TAP output from your ``unittest`` test cases. You
can use the TAP output files with a tool like the `Jenkins TAP plugin
<https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/TAP+Plugin>`_ or any other TAP
consumer.

tappy also provides a ``tappy`` command line tool as a TAP consumer. This tool
can read TAP files and display the results like a normal Python test runner.
tappy provides other TAP consumers via Python APIs for programmatic access to
TAP files.

For the curious: tappy sounds like "happy."
